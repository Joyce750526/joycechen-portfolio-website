      <p>Hello, I'm Joyce. I'm original from Taipei city, Taiwan. Joyce Chen was born in Taipei city, Taiwan. In her childhood, she was inspired by one of her family members in the architecture industry. This brought her to study interior design and architecture design at Academy of Art University in San Francisco. 
        She spent one year learning English in an ESL program at University of Tennessee. In 2013, she came back to San Francisco to pursue her interior design degree. Along with the learning process, she truly fell in love with interior design. Her dream was to help people create a welcoming home that can reflect their personalities and make their visions come true.
        She completed her degree in interior and architectural design in 2018 and soon started her professional career in an architectural firm right after an  internship. She learned a lot from her professional work to be detail-oriented, a problem solver, time manager and an accountable person. She keeps learning English, thanks to The Accelerated Career English (ACE) program at HCC that offered such a great opportunity for her to enhance her skills both professionally and personally.
        Later, she found herself falling in love with technology, and she desired to be a programmer. She is taking every step to achieve her career goal in a huge career switch by attending an online program for IT training and will also be joining a full stack web development bootcamp at University of New Hampshire. She just added a new page to her journey!
